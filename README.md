### Empowering the Rural Backbone Through Smart Market Intelligence

FinHack-DeeTee is a **farmer-first digital platform** designed to eliminate information asymmetry in agricultural markets. It helps farmers make **smarter selling decisions** by combining real-time mandi prices, profitability insights, and intuitive decision guidance — all in one simple interface.

Farmers often face:

As a result, they frequently sell their produce at **sub-optimal prices**, losing potential income.

✅ Smart profit calculation (price – transport cost)
✅ Best market recommendations
✅ Transparent decision reasoning
